# Codex Swap Account

**A safe, local Windows account switcher for the Codex desktop app.**

Switch between multiple Codex accounts from an overlay attached directly to the Codex window — with tray controls, global hotkeys, shared chat history, multi-monitor support, and automatic rollback if a switch fails.

## Why this exists

Using several Codex accounts normally means repeatedly signing out, opening a browser, completing authentication, and restarting your workflow.

Codex Swap Account turns that into a one-click action:

1. choose a profile in the overlay, tray menu, or with a hotkey;
2. the app safely saves the current authorization;
3. Codex restarts with the selected account;
4. your real workspace folders and chat history remain shared across every account.

The app runs quietly in the system tray and only shows the overlay when a verified Codex window is available.

## Highlights

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| **Fast switching** | Switch accounts from the overlay, tray menu, or `Ctrl + Alt + 1…9`. |
| **Shared Codex history** | Keep chats, projects, session history, and local Codex databases available from every account; only authorization changes. |
| **Compact and expanded modes** | Use a minimal dropdown or a one-click segmented profile bar. |
| **Safe transaction** | Back up the active authorization and automatically roll back if switching fails. |
| **Multi-monitor ready** | The overlay follows Codex across monitors, window moves, resizes, and DPI changes. |
| **Local only** | No telemetry, no cloud sync, no reverse proxy, and no credential upload. |
| **Tray companion** | Launch Codex, show/hide the overlay, manage profiles, and change settings from the tray. |
| **Bilingual UI** | English and Russian interface support. |
| **No admin rights** | Runs per-user and does not require a Windows service. |
| **Open source** | Built with C#, .NET 8, WPF, and a security-focused repository workflow. |

## Download

Go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ZOONGG/codex-swap-account/releases/latest).

Current stable release: **v1.0.0** (September 20, 2026).

Recommended download:

```text
CodexProfileOverlay-win-x64-portable.zip
```

Standalone executable:

```text
CodexProfileOverlay.exe
```

Integrity hashes:

```text
SHA256SUMS.txt
```

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- x64 system
- Codex desktop app
- Codex CLI available in `PATH` when adding a new profile

> [!NOTE]
> Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unsigned executable. This is expected for an independently distributed open-source build. Verify the SHA-256 hash from the release and review/build the source if you prefer.

## Quick start

1. Download `CodexProfileOverlay-win-x64-portable.zip`.
2. Extract the archive to a normal folder.
3. Run `CodexProfileOverlay.exe`.
4. Open Codex.
5. Use **Add profile** to authorize your accounts.
6. Select a profile from the overlay, tray menu, or a hotkey.

The application remains in the system tray. Closing the settings window does not exit the background process.

## Default hotkeys

| Action | Default shortcut |
|---|---|
| Show or hide the overlay | `Ctrl + Alt + C` |
| Switch to profile 1 | `Ctrl + Alt + 1` |
| Switch to profile 2 | `Ctrl + Alt + 2` |
| Switch to profile 3 | `Ctrl + Alt + 3` |
| Switch to profiles 4–9 | `Ctrl + Alt + 4…9` |

Hotkeys can be changed or cleared in **Settings → Hotkeys**. The app reports a conflict when Windows cannot register a shortcut.

## How switching works

On Windows, the desktop app is identified by its installation and product metadata, including Store versions whose executable and Start-menu display name are ChatGPT. Closing is limited to that desktop app and its Codex workers; VS Code, browsers, project servers, terminals, and the overlay are excluded. Restart uses the OpenAI.Codex AppUserModelID rather than the display name. If process identity cannot be verified, switching stops before changing authorization.

Codex normally stores local state under:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex
```

Codex Swap Account keeps both the directory and local state stable for every profile:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex
├── chats / sessions  ← shared by every profile
├── projects          ← shared by every profile
├── settings
├── history           ← shared by every profile
├── caches
├── databases
└── auth.json         ← the only switched file
```

Saved account profiles are stored separately:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex-profiles
├── Work
│   └── auth.json
├── Personal
│   └── auth.json
└── Backup
    └── auth.json
```

During a switch, the app:

1. prevents concurrent switch operations;
2. closes Codex gracefully;
3. on the first switch after upgrading, merges legacy per-profile sessions into shared history;
4. saves the freshly updated `auth.json` back to the active profile;
5. creates a backup of the current authorization;
6. atomically replaces `auth.json` with the selected profile;
7. records the active profile only after replacement succeeds;
8. launches Codex normally;
9. restores the previous authorization if any critical step fails.

The application does **not** switch or copy the `.codex` directory on every account change. This makes restarts faster, avoids locked SQLite conflicts, and keeps every local chat available from every profile.

### Rollback backup policy

Each new rollback backup contains only `previous-auth.json`, previous active-profile metadata, and a small hash/timestamp manifest. Sessions, rollout files, attachments, settings, databases, logs, caches, and project data are never copied. An authorization file above 10 MB or a switch backup above 25 MB is rejected before account state changes.

At startup and after a switch, the app keeps at most five completed backups, removes completed backups older than seven days, caps their total storage at 100 MB, and removes only clearly recognized abandoned temporary transactions older than 24 hours. Active transactions are never deleted. **Settings → Advanced** shows backup usage and provides actions to open the folder, clean completed backups, or inspect and explicitly clean legacy `state-*` backups while retaining the two newest.

## Adding a profile

The **Add profile** flow:

1. creates a directory under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-profiles`;
2. creates a profile-local `config.toml` when required;
3. runs `codex login` with `CODEX_HOME` set only for that login process;
4. waits for browser authentication;
5. checks that the profile authorization file exists;
6. adds the profile to the switcher.

The app never displays or logs the credential contents.

## Display modes

### Auto

Uses Expanded mode when enough space is available and Compact mode for narrow Codex windows. Hysteresis prevents mode flickering during resizing.

### Expanded

Shows all profiles as segmented buttons for immediate one-click switching.

### Compact

Shows the active profile in a smaller dropdown with access to profiles and common actions.

The overlay can be positioned after the Codex menu, centered, aligned right, or dragged to a custom location with the left mouse button. Drag anywhere on the panel, including an account button; a normal click still opens the menu or selects an account. The custom position is saved when you release the mouse and restored after restarting the overlay.

## Profile status and limit indicators

Settings → **Status and limits** provides optional local metadata for every profile: an emoji, a short label (24 characters), a note (120 characters), and an optional reset time. This data is saved in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay\profile-status.json`; it is never written to a profile directory or credential file. Manual labels and notes stay in Settings. A manual emoji can be enabled separately for the overlay and is off by default.

The automatic provider starts an isolated `codex app-server` with `CODEX_HOME` pointed at the selected profile and reads the structured `account/rateLimits/read` response. It no longer starts an interactive terminal or parses the rendered `/status` menu. **Test provider support** verifies this same data path immediately.

Only these automatic fields are cached: limit window label, remaining percentage, reset timestamp, capture timestamp, Codex CLI version, and the sanitized source `codex-cli-status`. The raw response, account email, session ID, model, permissions, directory, project path, and auth contents are not persisted.

When a supported provider becomes available, the overlay remains emoji-only:

- ⭐ recommended profile;
- 🟢 at or above the configurable high threshold (60% by default);
- 🟡 at or above the medium threshold (25% by default);
- 🔴 below the medium threshold or exhausted;
- no emoji for unknown, disabled, unavailable, failed, or stale data.

The effective capacity is the lowest remaining percentage across all reported windows. For example, 99% remaining in the 5-hour window plus 0% remaining in the weekly window is 🔴. A recommendation requires at least two fresh comparable profiles, maximizes that lowest percentage, then uses average capacity and nearest reset as tie-breakers. An exact tie produces no recommendation. Unknown usage is never displayed as zero. Cached automatic snapshots are kept when the feature is disabled or a refresh fails.

When the master toggle is off, no background CLI sessions are started, no automatic emoji is displayed, and cached snapshots are preserved. **Refresh now** intentionally refreshes the selected profile, while the normal overlay shows only one small emoji beside the profile name. Detailed percentages and reset times are shown in Settings and in the indicator tooltip.

## System tray

The tray menu provides:

- Open Codex
- Show or hide the switcher
- Switch profiles
- Open Settings
- Enable or disable Start with Windows
- Exit the application

The tray process stays alive when Codex is closed or minimized and automatically reattaches when Codex becomes available again.

## Privacy and security

Codex Swap Account is designed to operate entirely on the local machine.

- no telemetry;
- no analytics;
- no remote account database;
- no credential upload;
- no browser-cookie export;
- no reverse proxy;
- no Windows service;
- no administrator privileges;
- no parsing, printing, or logging of `auth.json` contents.

Local application data is stored under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay
```

This may contain non-secret settings, logs, backups, profile display metadata, and removed-profile backups.

Read the complete security policy in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Treat every `auth.json` file like a password. Never share it, attach it to an issue, or commit it to Git.

## Installation options

### Portable

Download the portable ZIP, extract it, and run:

```powershell
.\CodexProfileOverlay.exe
```

### Per-user installation from source

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Launch

## Troubleshooting

### Codex is not detected

- Make sure the official Codex desktop app is open.
- Restart Codex Swap Account.
- Check the logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay\logs`.
- Verify that Codex can be started normally.

### The overlay is hidden

- Press `Ctrl + Alt + C`.
- Left-click the tray icon.
- Use **Show switcher** from the tray menu.
- Check **Show automatically when Codex opens** in Settings.

### A hotkey does not work

Another application may already own that shortcut. Open **Settings → Hotkeys** and choose a different combination.

### A profile cannot send requests

The stored login may have expired or been revoked. Remove/re-add the local profile or authenticate it again through the Add profile flow.

### Windows SmartScreen blocks the app

Choose **More info → Run anyway** only after downloading from the official repository release and verifying the SHA-256 hash.

## Limitations

- Windows x64 only.
- Switching requires Codex to restart so it can load the selected authorization.
- Adding profiles requires the Codex CLI.
- The current installer is a per-user PowerShell installer rather than MSI/MSIX.
- The application depends on window/process metadata available to a normal Windows user process.
